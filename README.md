This is my school project (2nd year in college). It was make using Delphi 6, so I decided to convert it to Lazarus. It worked and program is functional. There are bugs, but I have no time to fix it, mainly because I completely forget Pascal. 

There is also a guide, however its language is Slovak. 

I decide to release this project as public domain.
